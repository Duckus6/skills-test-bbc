## Article Ranker Description
The Article Ranker fetches a list of articles and displays them to the user for them to read. Once all have been read, the user may rank them in order of preference and submit their ranking.


## Comments
Unfortunately due to time constraints the code is not 100% covered by tests and there is not a manual build for it. If I had more time I would have finished tests to get 100% coverage, expanded on some of the functionality (such as creating links to articles from the ranking page), error handling to handle different error codes and expanded on the CSS to make  the page much more visually appealing.
